Description:
Purpose of website is a demonstration of skills, ability and to use as a platform of a portfolio website, 
possibly to use for promotion to potential employers.

Functionality of site is basic 5 page site that connects through all pages in nav bar, 
all terminals in site have a "tilt" effect in tests it has some effect still in mobile veiw however would 
in real world probably still be much more useable in live mobile tests however this is an assumption.
The index "home page" has a terminal search/input box that can direct the user to any page by typing in the correct 
address(from the "ls" list) then hitting enter, in tests this works in mobile mode however is slightly less user friendly however
its not a major feature and more of somthing special on top.

As explained above a simple explaination of the site map is there are 5 basic pages that connect 
between eachother from the nav bar and the home page input box.

Theres a lot of relevant images, screen shots and pictures through the site all with alt text to 
assist in the accesibilty of the site.

Again, The target audience of the site is primarily for promotion to potential employers as the initial 
drop off point to move forward and make a new site or improve on this.

Tech stack for the site is primarily vanilla html, css and a touch of javascript for the effects and terminal feature.
