              Day 1: After setting up the whole website as the tile and seeing
              that it made me feel sick, I wasent sure if I wanted to continue
              with that setup, after pressing on and the background not working
              as it was not sitting underneath anything even after changing
              almost every z layer there was for a while and spending hours on
              hours trying to fix the positioning of the background div to cover
              the whole page I looked at my old site and thought huh wouldent it
              be cooler if I emulated a terminal and windows machine. after
              dumping the old background image then rewriting the whole site I
              was very happy with the end result.

            </li>
            <li>
              Day 2: Starting off with cleaning up the elements that I had
              previously set up, implementing a taskbar to increse the immersion
              of the windows machine as well as a ubuntu logo I saw the
              oppertunity to use that as the footer for my links as well
              perfectly fitting, I snipped the logos and downloaded others where
              I needed, unfortunately the windows bar was missforming when
              resizing so I photoshoped the original logo out copied a seperate
              one then pasted it on top, perfectly it allowed me to stack the
              other icons behind it too! continuing from there I decieded i need
              to acctually start on a page other than professionalHistory so I
              started with the index and went even more ham on the concept I
              wanted to add a console command feature to allow the person to
              type where they wanted to go, currently a work in progress. Later
              that day my good friend jumped on discord with me and helped me
              work though a few issues one being a open div and ways to help fix
              the top image from not scaling properly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Day 2.5: implement the open div fix to all pages, then move the
              footer to a div inside the body and the wrapper div to get the
              whole card to use the script.<p1 class="underscore">_</p1>
            </li>
            <li>
              Day 3: Today I started off figuring out how to make SVG icons work
              and how to scale them, it didnt start off very well and I wasent
              getting anywhere so I asked an instructor for help and we were
              able to figure it out and fix the issues in the end, additionally
              I had a few other problems and James helped me out with all of
              them as well, first was the input field that I was attempting to
              make into the console to interact first we set it up with a simple
              button a few console logs, then made it on keydown of the enter
              key I am very happy with the result and after leaving I spiff it
              up by making it fit the theming. Later I continue with the
              taskbars fix and making svg's replace the logos for better
              responsiveness.
