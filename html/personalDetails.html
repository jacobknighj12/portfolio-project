          I have a few different hobbies; Gaming, anime, manga, comics,
          lockpicking, swordfighting and making games.
        </p1>
        <p1 class="paragraphs">
          Recently I have been heavily playing Escape from tarkov, however I am
          a life long player of the toxic game league of legends, as well as
          playing many other types of games and niche titles.
        </p1>
        <p1 class="paragraphs">
          I have watched and read anime and manga for most of my teen life to
          current, so much anime in fact that I'm quite proud that I can semi
          profiecently speak japanise and understand the majority of the shows
          without subtitles.
        </p1>
        <p1 class="paragraphs">
          Comics been a more recent addition due to not finding the sort of
          manga I want to read, searching around I found specificly webcomic
          apps like webtoon serve amazing small creators making amazing storys.
        </p1>
        <p1 class="paragraphs">
          I picked up lockpicking about 2 years ago after watching way too many
          lockpicking videos. its basicly a fun game mechanic in real life and I
          get the rush of being able to pick harder and harder locks, it also
          being useful like in a situation where my nan lost her keys to her
          window and I lockpicked it open (ignore the fact that, that specific
          window took 2 hours to pick).
        </p1>
        <p1 class="paragraphs">
          I started joining a Battle game style LARP about 6 years ago called
          swordcraft
          <a href="swordcraft"></a> and through that in the bands that you were
          a part of in training sessions you learned how to properly fight,
          protect yourself but most importantly in that specific situation pull
          your blows lessening the force when you hit another person, the game
          is very fast paced and many different people gather to play it with
          over 200 people back in the normal non covid days every week on friday
          in royal park.
        </p1>
        <p1 class="paragraphs">
          As stated in Professional-History I studied digital and interactive
          games, from there I have made a few game jam games with some friends
          and made a fair few half baked but never complete hobby games. My
          current unfinished project that I am slowly working on is called
          Adventure quest clone.
